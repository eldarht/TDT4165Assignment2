# TDT4165Assignment2

Lexer, tokenizer, interpreter and Parser written in [oz](http://mozart.github.io/) for micro [dc](https://www.gnu.org/software/bc/manual/dc-1.05/html_mono/dc.html).

Task completion:

- task 1) a-f Are answered by [List.oz](List.oz)
- task 2) a-g Are answered by [Tokenizer.oz](Tokenizer.oz)
- task 3) a-b Are answered by [Infix.oz](Infix.oz)
- task 4) Is partiallyAnswered by next section in the README.md

## Task 4

<!--
a)Formally describe the regular grammar of the lexemes in task 2.

b)Describe the grammar of the infix notation in task 3 using (E)BNF. Beware of operator precedence.  Isthe grammar ambiguous?  Explain why it is or is not ambiguous?

c)What is the difference between a context-sensitive and a context-free grammar?
-->

d) You may have gotten float-int errors in task 2.  If you havenâ€™t, try running1+1.0.  Why does this happen?Why is this a useful error?

```
Float and int are not of the same type. This provides some type safety and can help locate bugs in ones code. In terms of grammar, i allows greater flexibility when formally defining usage rules and precedence.
